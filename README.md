# 🏦 Bank Loan Report Dashboard  

This project showcases an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze and monitor bank loan performance data.  
Developed using **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **SQL**, it tracks key metrics such as **total loan applications**, **funded amount**, **received amount**, and **average interest rate**.  
SQL was used to clean, transform, and query large loan datasets, while Power BI visualizes trends in **good vs. bad loans**, **repayment behavior**, and **financial risk assessment** to support data-driven decision-making.

## 🎯 Project Objective  

The main objective of this project is to **analyze and monitor bank loan performance** using data visualization and SQL-based analysis.  
It aims to identify key factors affecting loan approval, repayment, and defaults by tracking important metrics such as **funded amount**, **interest rate**, and **DTI (Debt-to-Income ratio)**.  
This helps financial analysts and decision-makers gain actionable insights, reduce credit risk, and improve overall lending efficiency.
